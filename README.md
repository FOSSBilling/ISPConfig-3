# ISPConfig 3 Server Manager for FOSSBilling

This repository is for the ISPConfig 3 server manager for FOSSBilling.
This server manager is currently unmaintained and does not function correctly. If you use ISPConfig 3 and are a developer, we'd appreciate it if someone could assist in getting it functional again & maintain it.

## Installation
1. Download the `Ispconfig3.php` file from the source code
2. Copy the downloaded `Ispconfig3.php` file to `/library/server/manager/Ispconfig3.php`in your FOSSBilling instance.
